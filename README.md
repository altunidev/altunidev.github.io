# AltUniDev Public Website

This repository stores documentation and configuration files to run my public-facing website through Github Pages. Branches are organized as such:

- **[Main](https://github.com/altunidev/altunidev.github.io/tree/main):** Stores all documents and documentation in an organized mess.
- **[Dev](https://github.com/altunidev/altunidev.github.io/tree/dev):** Used as an active development scene. Testing and development goes on here. Generally this is unstable because I break things pretty often. But on a normal day, it's only markdown files being edited here so there's really no need to worry too much about it all.
- **[GH-Pages](https://github.com/altunidev/altunidev.github.io/tree/gh-pages):** Github Pages looks at this branch for all hosting needs. As such, this branch is a very bare-bones stripped down copy of the development branch, hosting only necessary files to be broadcast on the public site.
