I bought a used Quest 2 (HMD only, excludes strap, facial interface, controllers, etc.). Found a great deal on eBay for $38 -- total turned out to be less than $45 all told. If it works, that'll be an amazing price to get something for hardware development and learning.

The biggest reason why I decided to buy this is because I wanted to have a headset that *works*, but otherwise couldn't care less about. As such, I can take it apart and put it back together however and whenever I want, mostly for learning but also just general curiosity. I hope to be more informed on an applied manner (rather than purely theoretical) on the hardware as well as software systems that go into this technology. I find that doing things hands-on is a great way to learn for me. Being able to build my own PC, and also take apart my laptop, put things back together, etc. was a great way for me to learn the necessary systems and hardware that goes into making everything work in a computer. Taking this sort of experience and applying it to a VR headset would hopefully help me learn more specific implementations for head-mounted human-computer interactions.

Additionally, being able to talk with others in the community and teach people about the benefits and difficulties of the specific hardware would be very useful in being socially integrated to technical-minded VR enthusiast groups.

Oh yeah, and also having a wireless VR headset could help with certain activities in VR such as dance, acrobatics, and more!
