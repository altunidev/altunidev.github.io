# 2023-10-13 | Research and Development Costs

This project was started to provide SteamVR users a means to use SteamVR controllers without having to purchase Valve Index controllers (nicknamed "Knuckles") or HTC Vive controllers (nicknamed "Wands"), as these form factors may be seen as unsatisfactory to certain audiences. While this was the primary goal, a few secondary goals would be to ensure that users can build, adapt, and re-design controllers (by using the frameworks provided in this project) to their unique use-case along with keeping cost as low as possible for certain use-cases. (Essentially, if a user wants a lighthouse-tracked controller with just triggers, system buttons, and very small batteries for BeatSaber gameplay, this design should be easily adapted to that use-case.)

With that in mind, I would like to provide full transparency on the cost of development periodically so users may have a better idea of how much it may cost to build a pair of controllers themselves as well as potentially making customizations as per preference and hardware choice. Additionally, should project funding occur, there will be a clear indication as to where funds are allocated.

Currently, monetary development costs for this project are zero as this is very early in the process. However, below is a draft of the structure I'll use (subject to change as the project progresses).
