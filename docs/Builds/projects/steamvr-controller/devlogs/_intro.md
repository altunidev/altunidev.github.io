# Introduction

This directory will house documents used for informal devloging on this project. In this area, I'll provide updates, considerations, design decisions, and other information that may not fit in general documentation. Devlog notes will be named with the date first before topic and subtopic (as necessary), so as to provide easier sorting and filtering. Additionally, these devlog notes may be mirrored on my website for a nicer front-end view for readability and ease of navigation.
