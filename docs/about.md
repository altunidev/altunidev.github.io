# About

Ah, I see you found your way to the About Page! Well, since you're here, allow me to provide just a little bit of meta-information on this website and various choices I've made for it.

## A Quick Q&A

### Who are you?

Hey! My online alias is Salty. How's it going?

I see myself as a technologist, artist, gaming enthusiast, and all around general nerd. Generally speaking, I don't go with conventional societal labels and would rather let my thoughts and stories to define me instead.

If you'd like to find me elsewhere on the interwebs, head over to my [Links](links.md) page!

### Why did you make this website?

Originally, I was urged to make a website as a means to show off a portfolio for past keyboard builds in case anyone were interested in possibly commissioning me to build them a board. However, I kept sort-of putting off the entire thing until the individuals interested fell out of contact, so I was left with a partially-written, partially-incomplete keyboard portfolio. Eventually, I figured, "well I've got a lot of thoughts, ideas, and projects I can write about, I might as well start a blog somewhere... but where?"

Well hey, I've already got the beginnings of a website, so why not just re-orient things to be more of an informal portfolio while also providing a home for my infrequent bloggy talky talky and such? And so this website was officially formed!

### What does AltUniDev mean?

!!! question "Hey Salty, what does AltUniDev even mean?"

**AltUniDev** was a mashup of three words I was thinking about at one point in time when trying to describe myself to... myself (strange to think about, I know). Essentially, I wanted to find something that described me as who I am, as accurately as possible. I'm neither a super artistic-minded person nor am I the most overtly technical individual either. However, I'm both technical and artistic while also having quite an ear (or eye?) for linguistics and writing. I've done fiction writing, poetry, music, photography, and videography. At the same time, I've also done software development, electronics hardware experiments, worked IT and even built electric race cars! So what is a good description for a perpetual day-dreamer who so happens to also be technology enthusiast?

Well I settled on "**Alternative Universe Developer**", or "**AltUniDev**" for short. I think it's clever anyway.

!!! question "Okay, so why the difference between "Salty" and "AltUniDev"?"

Well that's because I like to have a bit of a distinction between my online alias and the projects I work with. Essentially, the way I think about it is that "AltUniDev" is an organization that is comprised of one individual: Salty. It may be expanded to more in the future, or may remain just myself -- only time will tell, I suppose.
