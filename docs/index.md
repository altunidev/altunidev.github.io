# Welcome to AltUniDev!

<h2> ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! </h2>

I'm Salty. I run AltUniDev as a name to an umbrella amalgamation for many various projects, hobbies, and whatever else I'm interested in. On this website, you can expect blog posts, electronics experiments, keyboard builds, and other bits and bobs.

ðŸš§ At this current moment in time, this website is still *under development*, so please don't mind the dust. ðŸš§

In the meantime while things are being built out, feel free to help yourself to some cookies and tea, I'm sure the expiration label is just a suggestion. The couch is over here and the fridge is over there. Make yourself at home!

### [Blog](blog/intro.md)

In this section, you can find some of my many various ramblings on whatever topic I feel like talking about.

### [Custom Electronics Projects](builds/projects/completed-intro.md)

I tend to tinker with various things here and there. In this section are some of the projects that I consider to be "working", "successful", or otherwise have something to report on with a state of being "finished".

### [Learning Electronics](builds/learnings/learning-intro.md)

This section is more-so used as an overflow for things that may not have worked so well in the above section -- electronics projects that were used simply for learning, developing an idea, or perhaps something failed along the way and the cost of continuing was a little too high for the scope of the project. While reporting failures may seem like a negative, I believe that it's through mistakes that we learn and develop to have a stronger skill set. Plus, some outcomes of failed projects might make for really funny moments, so hey, let's embrace some chaos here!

### [Keyboard Builds](builds/keyboards/keyboard-builds-intro.md)

Back in college, I used to build quite a few keyboards. These were mostly just for my own enjoyment as I found the design and building process of keyboards to be very fascinating both from a technical and artistic perspective. Plus, custom mechanical keyboards (while more expensive than conventional membrane keyboards) are relatively cheap, quick, and easy to purchase a kit, design, build, and complete. Some quick satisfying projects overall, and commissions are always great ways to help more people get their hands on high quality contraptions.
