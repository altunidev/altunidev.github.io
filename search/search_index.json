However, I'm both technical and artistic while also having quite an ear (or eye?) for linguistics and writing. I've done fiction writing, poetry, music, photography, and videography. At the same time, I've also done software development, electronics hardware experiments, worked IT and even built electric race cars!

Of course, one may ask \"Why build yourself another board when you've already built yourself one perfectly usable 65% board?\", to which any keyboard enthusiast's response may result in laughter or comments of \"oh my sweet summer child...\"</p> <p>In truth, I was simply wanting to have a 75% layout as when I play games, I started finding myself at a disadvantage by not being able to press <code>F1</code>, <code>F5</code>, <code>F8</code>, or backtick (`) without first holding <code>Fn</code> on the other side of the spacebar and activating a temporary layer. Well, that and also I wanted to have my spacebar give me a little more feedback so when I jump in a game, I know when I actuate the key, so I can measure the delay between actuation and action on screen. I also wanted a brass plate instead of aluminum because a slightly denser material results in a bit of a nicer sound (in my opinion). Additionally, I kind of also wanted a little more functionality and available layers on the board along with a little more transparent RGB so I can customize the aesthetics and-- and-- and...</p> <p>So I wanted a new keyboard because I wanted a new keyboard. Fine, I admit it! But I decided that this was an opportunity for me to improve on everything that I liked in my previous board while adding on features that were custom tailored to me.

I actually noticed quite an interesting habit I've developed in that when typing normal sentences, I hold my right thumb high above the board as it ends up being largely unused in any given point in time. Additionally, I strictly use my left pinky to hold down the <code>Shift</code> key, but prefer to have a softer actuation feel on <code>LShift</code> and <code>LCtrl</code> when it comes to longer gaming sessions. Another thing I was thinking about was reducing the overall mass of the space button -- this also resulted in allowing two other buttons to take its place (which I later configured to activate various keyboard layers). This, along with many other considerations, resulted in me prototyping many different sorts of layouts with varying switch types. I had quite a few different switches on hand thanks to my previous builds along with my general curiousity and hanging out with a few other keyboard enthusiasts, so I was able to experiment a little to try and refine this design. The result: a very personalized switch layout that is custom-tailored to my typing style.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Builds/keyboards/personal/Hazards/#build-process","title":"Build Process","text":""},{"location":"Builds/keyboards/personal/Hazards/#lubrication-and-preparation","title":"Lubrication and Preparation","text":"<p>The build process of this board was rather experimental in essence. I had some keyswitches in mind, but overall wasn't too picky about lesser-pressed keys. So I ended up ordering some Durock Linears for the alpha keys, Arctos 65g's for modifier keys, and decided that Halo Trues were a lot smoother of a tactile feel, so those should be in place for the mod keys that I'd be pressing more often with my weaker fingers. This being so, I decided I wanted a little more resistance over mod keys that I'd press less during gaming or press with my thumb, so <code>LWin</code>, <code>LAlt</code>, and <code>Space</code> were all Arctos. Because these were already slightly lubed from the factory, I found that it only needed a very light greasing to get the feeling just right while the springs needed a generous amount of lube to reduce on pinging sounds. However, due to the fact that I was building this board after having just finished working on two TKL builds and one numpad build, I allowed myself to be a little more lazy and decided the factory lube was enough for the most part, only touching up on spring ping and select switches that I found were the least consistently lubed.</p>"},{"location":"Builds/keyboards/personal/Hazards/#evaluation","title":"Evaluation","text":"<p>After having lubed and put a good majority of switches through my quality control tests (comparing one switch to another by feel and sound), I separated the switches from most favourable to least and started placing the most favourable ones on the left end of the board (where most of the keys would be for gaming) and some on the right (around the arrow cluster area) while scattering the less favourable randomly so overall the good would be balanced with the bad and I won't notice any major inconsistency with quality. And for the most part, that worked just perfectly -- any of the Arctos switches that felt a little less lubed and more scratchy were ones I put closer to the <code>F9</code> to <code>F12</code> area as those keys are used significantly less than <code>F1</code> to <code>F6</code>.</p>"},{"location":"Builds/keyboards/personal/Hazards/#soldering","title":"Soldering","text":"<p>The soldering process was rather trivial as at this point, I've had quite a lot of experience with soldering keyboards.

While this is slightly unfortunate for someone like me who frequently types without looking at the keyboard, it didn't take too much time for me to just simply get used to placing my hands approximately where I needed them to be and start typing, adjusting my hand placement whenever needed. Additionally, this set didn't include the necessary keycaps for a split space-bar layout, so I decided to swap out the main space bar with two split bar pieces from the keycap set in my first build along with a slightly larger cap for the middle space key. This ended up working just perfectly for my needs.</p> <p>While this ended up being a board of mis-matched parts from other builds, overall it turned out to be one of my favourite builds to date, simply with the amount of thought put into the board in general as well as the customization done to the switches and the layout overall. I really enjoyed the process and it gave me a lot of confidence to build more layouts taht are bold, unique, and unmistakenly built for one individual only that one individual.

I had little to no experience in soldering, lubrication, or anything to do with keyboards other than typing. But I was determined to get into the hobby -- for the customizability, for the click-clacks, and for the community. So I ordered a kit with little knowledge of what I was getting myself into.</p> <p>This was my first ever custom keyboard, introducing me to the scene of DIY and custom mechanical builds. While I started off with an OEM gaming board, a majority of my life and interaction with computers was with membrane keyboards. So when it came time to build this board, it was a very exciting event for me. My main intention with this board was to immerse myself in the environment of building custom boards and learning as much as I can. To this point, it was designed to help me also learn my own preferences in a custom board and explore possible options for future builds. I ordered parts that would allow for the most repetition, which offered a lot of practice to refine my hands-on skills with custom electronics including keyswitch lubrication and soldering.</p>"},{"location":"Builds/keyboards/personal/Honey-Smooth/#research","title":"Research","text":"<p>From my previous gaming board (using non-lubricated Cherry MX Red switches), I knew I wanted to use linear switches as I preferred a uniform action while typing and gaming.

While my primary aim was to learn from this build, I also wanted to make something that I would be happy using daily. So I went from a TKL gaming keyboard to a 65% to reduce on costs while still providing me with all the keys I'd need on a normal day (the arrow cluster is very regularly used on my boards). From here, I was sure I was ready to order everything. It took all of a few minutes to find the most budget-friendly parts and even look for further discounts from other websites.

I got to work, following the videos as a guide while experimenting using differing amounts of lube per each part. After about ten or so switches, I started to get the hang of the process. And so I started to lube the stabilizers before installing them. As with the guides, I tested the sound of the stabilizers with some modded switches and some keycaps from my older keyboard. It sounded alright enough to my untrained ear, so I turned on a nice D&amp;D podcast and proceeded to lube and film the rest of the 70 switches I've allocated to this build.</p>"},{"location":"Builds/keyboards/personal/Honey-Smooth/#the-hot-stuff-soldering","title":"The Hot Stuff (Soldering)","text":"<p>The soldering process went rather smooth thanks to some of my previous experience with soldering through-hole and surface-mount electronics.

In fact, I still use this keyboard for most of my typing, writing, productivity, and general computer usage when sat at my desk.</p> <p>However, it wasn't anything special for the fact of the stabilizers not being clipped (due to me not having flush cutters on hand at the time) or even having a band-aid mod installed (as I didn't know how that would benefit the sound signature). No, it was special because it was something I built. It helped me learn not only how a keyboard was built, but also how to tune specific configurations in the hardware, the firmware, and even change how the keyboard feels. It gave me ideas on how I'd want my next board to feel, gave me the ability to think outside of just uniform switch layouts and experiment with different concepts.

Actually had to check my Valve Purchase history to be sure as to when I bought them, it was the fourth of June, 2023. While taking the time to look back here, I also purchased my first base stations on the sixth of May, 2023 -- at the time, I was daily-driving an HP Reverb G2 (v2) with WMR controllers and was wanting to get into Full Body Tracking (FBT), so I purchased some Tundra Trackers. Essentially, I was in the Base Station ecosystem for about a month before getting my hands on Knuckles.</p> <p>For context, I was coming from an Oculus Rift S before the HP Reverb G2. The controllers on the Rift S were great, fine for most of my use-cases and overall rather pleasant to use as far as controllers go (perhaps a little creaky on the spring for the trigger and grip, but nothing functionally wrong). However, when I switched to the Reverb G2 and its appropriate controllers (as the Rift S controllers were incompatible with the G2), my experience overall degraded very quickly based on many factors:</p> <ul> <li>The overall battery life, despite having twice the amount of AA batteries in the enclosure, was significantly worse than that of the Rift S.</li> <li>The build quality of the plastics felt very flimsy, cheap, and rattley (for the lack of a better word).</li> <li>It felt significantly heavier than Rift S controllers.</li> <li>The area in which the controllers were trackable was less than my field of view.<ul> <li>In other words, if I put my hand in a certain area of my view, the controller would stop being tracked due to the cameras losing consistent sight of the tracking ring and light constellation being emitted.</li> </ul> </li> <li>As a VRChat player, the lack of capacitive buttons and thumbsticks made expressions very difficult to consistently control</li> </ul> <p>Essentially, from the time I first got my G2 and full body tracking, I decided this wasn't nearly enough. I wanted something else. Obviously no other controllers would really work with my current setup unless I went with light house tracked controllers... so I decided to go with the best out there for PCVR: Valve Index Controllers (Knuckles).</p> <p>The overall experience from receiving and setting up the controllers was nothing short of great -- Valve has an impressive end-user experince when it comes to unboxing hardware, as I've found with the base stations a month prior. Even the shipping box having call-outs to the Portal Companion Cube was something I genuinely found cute -- I really appreciated the little details they put into the unboxing experience. But the unboxing only happens once.</p> <p>Pairing the controllers took me a bit of a process as I was already on a G2 (which didn't have integrated Watchman dongles like the Index). I purchased the Tundra Tracking 4 pack, which provided me with an SW4 dongle. However, using three of the four possible connections for FBT meant that there was only room for one of the two controllers to be used at any given point in time. That was, until I found the firmware on my Steam Controller dongle could be flashed to work on the Watchman protocol. Following some guides helped me figure out how to do this and it was rather easy from here to pair my second controller.</p> <p>At this point, I managed to pair two Knuckles, three Tundra Trackers, and get the G2 working within SteamVR -- I had to calibrate to make sure everything was perfect (it wasn't perfect... but my rants for the G2 may wait for a future post). Once everything was where it should be and working nicely, I tested that the fingers were working as expected in the SteamVR Home as well as Valve's The Lab experience. Overall, an immediate thing I notiecd was the build quality and consistency of materials being used was generally higher, inspiring a lot more confidence in the construction and care put into the design overall. I also noticed the sensitivity of the finger tracking leading to much more immersive experiences. However, these experiences weren't enough. I wanted to get the whole \"shabang\".</p> <p>I jumped into VRChat and did as any VRChat player would -- stood in front of a mirror. I just took some time to just look at my hands, look at my avatar's hands, and try to see how these related to my hands. It clicked. It felt great. It felt natural. It felt intuitive. It was amazing, I loved it!</p> <p>But I noticed just a few things straight from the first time using them. Particularly the calibration on the fingers didn't seem completely accurate to my fingers. Not too bad of a problem, just recalibrate by drumming my fingers on the grips (I learned this trick a little later; a very clever means of on-the-fly calibration, hats off to you, Valve). But then I noticed that the fingers only worked for my index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers. The thumb was subjected to simply the capacitive \"Stick\", \"Touchpad\", \"B\", or \"A\" buttons for different thumb positional tracking. However, last I recall, thumbs can go over the individual fingers to form a fist, instead of simply resting on the outside as if it's holding a controller -- and thumbs have a much larger range of motion than all other fingers, yet it's got the least available on this controller style... Perhaps I was missing something though! I kept using it because overall, it's a great package.</p>"},{"location":"blogs/20231031-IndexKnuckles/#issues","title":"Issues","text":"<p>Over time though, some more quirks were revealed to me. Particularly, when I set aside a little bit of money and purchased myself a Bigscreen Beyond (on the twelfth of July, 2023), I was able to interact with many others of the like mind who decided to also pre-order the Beyond headset. Such community members had experiences varying from similar to me (having only used VR consistently for about a year to 14 months at that point) to those who would be considered VR Veterans, having pre-ordered the first Rift Development Kit, working hand-in-hand with some of the earliest creators of VR in general. They've run the VR gauntlet and come back home all before breakfast, as it were... so having the ability to interact as one of them in a community of \"We all shelled out a paycheck for a headset\" was rather valuable in getting insight as to various things with VR in general as well as certain experiences in specific.</p> <p>Valve Knuckles were a very specific topic that has been, and (as of writing) continues to be a topic to talk about in this particular community of PCVR enthusiasts. From much of my interactions and lurking, I found some of the most annoying things on Knuckles were the following:</p> <ul> <li>Quality Assurance (QA)<ul> <li>Overall, the Knuckles are fine. However, there have been some who've expressed much disappointment in ensuring the product worked out of the box without RMA.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Long Term Reliability<ul> <li>\"Stick Drift\" being one of the biggest complaints I've seen overall. At the time of the Index release (2019), hall effect joysticks haven't yet been wide-spread and easily attainable through a supply chain. Since its first release, the Knuckles haven't seemed to change significantly, if at all, and so the sticks continue to use potentiometer-based angle sensing</li> </ul> </li> <li>Durability<ul> <li>Essentially, the idea of \"if I hit something because I have a screen on my face, I should expect that the thing in my hand shouldn't break instantly\". Fortunately, I personally never had any experience of this sort of thing happening to me, but I could definitely see a few points in the construction where a non-trivial amount of mechanical stress may affect the structural integrity and cause a few things to snap.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Size<ul> <li>\"Knuckles are too big for my hands\". While ergonomics is a very difficult challenge to overcome for all customers, I can at least respect Valve for trying to accommodate a wide variety of audiences by making these controllers too large rather than too small (and potentially unuseable for big-hand havers).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Gesture Control<ul> <li>While Knuckles provide a wide range of gesture control with individually poseable fingers, in games such as VRChat where each finger gesture may change an expression on the avatar's face, or trigger certain actions, having consistency in these actions is a necessity.</li> <li>Unfortunately, due to the on-the-fly calibration working the way it is, sometimes the algorithms may be thrown off and, on occasion, a ring-finger on the left hand would pop out randomly. Or perhaps the proximity sensor under the trigger enclosure may think there's an object close-by (when there really isn't), and the index finger in-game would be half bent.</li> <li>Overall this has been a very large pain point for me personally as I not only rely on gesture control for accurate VRChat face expression puppeteering, but also phantom sense.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>So in essence, while these issues are much easier to live with than, say, the ones detailed above in my segment of complaints about the WMR controller provided with the G2, they are issues regardless. So what alternatives do we have compared to the Knuckles?</p> <p>Really, if you're in the Light House ecosystem, that's about it. It's either Knuckles, Vive Controllers (nicknamed Wands), or Pimax Swords -- and neither of the other two have joysticks or proper button control like the Knuckles. Of course, Etee controllers, at this current point of writing, have been released. However, from what I've seen and heard, they provide users only finger tracking and a single trackpad on the top of the controller with (also) no useable buttons. This makes it very difficult to use as a versatile replacement to the Valve Knuckles in all gaming and social situations for VR applications. Overall, the Knuckles are the most versitile, available, and complete package. They are great, amazing pieces of technology provided by Valve. And really, they're the best we got. But based on the issues above, it's become clear to me that Knuckles are simply not enough.</p> <p>That all being said, while the Knuckles are within warrantee, I've heard great things about Valve Support. Personally, I've only needed to RMA one of my base stations (out of four, at the time of writing), and Valve Support was prompt, kind, and able to get everything sorted out for me -- within less than a week and a half, I had everything set up again and ready to go. While a great customer service could go a long way, from a user-perspective, the fact that individuals are aware that they may need to reach out means that the product inherently has flaws that should have been addressed earlier in the design and engineering stages.</p>"},{"location":"blogs/20231031-IndexKnuckles/#okay-enough-complaining","title":"Okay, enough complaining!","text":"<p>Fine, fine -- I do like complaining though, sometimes it's fun! Anyway...</p> <p>So what now? Do we, both casual enjoyers and deep-diving VR enthusiasts continue using Valve Knuckles? What could we do? Well currently unless you're open to using something like Vive Wands, Pimax Swords, or Etee controllers... Knuckles may be the only option currently, and the best option out there overall for finger tracking controllers with full functionality and features. But let me raise the question: is this the best we can do?</p> <p>I would argue that the potential for VR controller technology improvements is massive. And to demonstrate this, I've decided that I would like to document, if not build, a few ideas that I've been having for various use-cases and designs for alternatives and potentially viable competitors to the Knuckles. In fact, at the beginning of October, 2023, I was talking with a few community members in the Bigscreen Beyond channels and we agreed that there should exist more alternatives and competitors to the Knuckles -- in terms of ergonomics, input accuracy, reliability, and ease of use. It was from such conversations that I began this exact project: https://github.com/altunidev/SteamVR-Controller .</p> <p>In other words, it was through our collective dissatisfaction that I began to develop a few ideas for a product that, to begin with, may be an open source and open hardware design. However, I've also heard quite a bit of dissatisfaction with DIY options as these all felt \"cheap\", or support would be very much a \"Oh this broke, hot glue it back together!\" rather than having a refined, well-produced item in hand. From these sorts of comments and feedback, I currently have a personal goal of selling these such controllers as products for end-users to purchase at some point in the future. The sooner, the better, but I am but one person in a vast world of opportunity.</p> <p>That all being said, I do hope that through my projects and goals like these, I can help others be more immersed and, perhaps, enjoy their virtual experinces just a little more -- either together or in their own worlds, however they would like to use this technology!</p>"},{"location":"blogs/intro/","title":"Intro","text":"<p>Table of Contents WIP</p> <p>\ud83d\udea7 All blog pages WIP currently \ud83d\udea7</p>"}]}
