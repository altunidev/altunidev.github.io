I had little to no experience in soldering, lubrication, or anything to do with keyboards other than typing. But I was determined to get into the hobby -- for the customizability, for the click-clacks, and for the community. So I ordered a kit with little knowledge of what I was getting myself into.</p> <p>This was my first ever custom keyboard, introducing me to the scene of DIY and custom mechanical builds. While I started off with an OEM gaming board, a majority of my life and interaction with computers was with membrane keyboards. So when it came time to build this board, it was a very exciting event for me. My main intention with this board was to immerse myself in the environment of building custom boards and learning as much as I can. To this point, it was designed to help me also learn my own preferences in a custom board and explore possible options for future builds. I ordered parts that would allow for the most repetition, which offered a lot of practice to refine my hands-on skills with custom electronics including keyswitch lubrication and soldering.</p>"},{"location":"Personal%20Builds/Honey%20Smooth/#research","title":"Research","text":"<p>From my previous gaming board (using non-lubricated Cherry MX Red switches), I knew I wanted to use linear switches as I preferred a uniform action while typing and gaming. From absolutely everywhere I looked, I read that lubrication drastically improves switch sound and feel, so I found some tools to help with the lubrication process and learned where to apply the grease. While my primary aim was to learn from this build, I also wanted to make something that I would be happy using daily. So I went from a TKL gaming keyboard to a 65% to reduce on costs while still providing me with all the keys I'd need on a normal day (the arrow cluster is very regularly used on my boards). From here, I was sure I was ready to order everything. It took all of a few minutes to find the most budget-friendly parts and even look for further discounts from other websites. After this, it was time to wait for all the parts to ship!</p>"},{"location":"Personal%20Builds/Honey%20Smooth/#build-and-finish","title":"Build and Finish","text":"<p>Alright, the parts have been shipped, what's the next step?</p>"},{"location":"Personal%20Builds/Honey%20Smooth/#lubrication-and-preparation","title":"Lubrication and Preparation","text":""},{"location":"Personal%20Builds/Honey%20Smooth/#gallery","title":"Gallery","text":""}]}
