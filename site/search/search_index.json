Essentially, I wanted to find something that described me as who I am, as accurately as possible. I'm neither a super artistic-minded person nor am I the most overtly technical individual either. However, I'm both technical and artistic while also having quite an ear (or eye?) for linguistics and writing. I've done fiction writing, poetry, music, photography, and videography. At the same time, I've also done software development, electronics hardware experiments, worked IT and even built electric race cars!

I think it's clever anyway.</p> <p>Okay, so why the difference between \"Salty\" and \"AltUniDev\"?</p> <p>Well that's because I like to have a bit of a distinction between my online alias and the projects I work with.

time of being a mish-mash of thrown-together parts that somehow work really well together. That all being said, once it was finished, it instantly became my daily driver along with my absolute favourite board for gaming.</p>"},{"location":"builds/keyboards/personal/Hazards/#pre-research","title":"Pre-Research","text":"<p>By the point in time I started researching for my second board, I've already built three boards (my first board, my brother's board, and my sister-in-law's board), which gave me enough experience and confidence to try and build a board that's been highly personalized for my own tastes and typing habits. Of course, one may ask \"Why build yourself another board when you've already built yourself one perfectly usable 65% board?\", to which any keyboard enthusiast's response may result in laughter or comments of \"oh my sweet summer child...\"</p> <p>In truth, I was simply wanting to have a 75% layout as when I play games, I started finding myself at a disadvantage by not being able to press <code>F1</code>, <code>F5</code>, <code>F8</code>, or backtick (`) without first holding <code>Fn</code> on the other side of the spacebar and activating a temporary layer. Well, that and also I wanted to have my spacebar give me a little more feedback so when I jump in a game, I know when I actuate the key, so I can measure the delay between actuation and action on screen. I also wanted a brass plate instead of aluminum because a slightly denser material results in a bit of a nicer sound (in my opinion). Additionally, I kind of also wanted a little more functionality and available layers on the board along with a little more transparent RGB so I can customize the aesthetics and-- and-- and...</p> <p>So I wanted a new keyboard because I wanted a new keyboard. Fine, I admit it! But I decided that this was an opportunity for me to improve on everything that I liked in my previous board while adding on features that were custom tailored to me. And so I began my research to make a highly personalized board for myself...</p>"},{"location":"builds/keyboards/personal/Hazards/#research","title":"Research","text":"<p>I took the time to analyze how I even typed in the first place. I actually noticed quite an interesting habit I've developed in that when typing normal sentences, I hold my right thumb high above the board as it ends up being largely unused in any given point in time. Additionally, I strictly use my left pinky to hold down the <code>Shift</code> key, but prefer to have a softer actuation feel on <code>LShift</code> and <code>LCtrl</code> when it comes to longer gaming sessions. Another thing I was thinking about was reducing the overall mass of the space button -- this also resulted in allowing two other buttons to take its place (which I later configured to activate various keyboard layers). This, along with many other considerations, resulted in me prototyping many different sorts of layouts with varying switch types. I had quite a few different switches on hand thanks to my previous builds along with my general curiousity and hanging out with a few other keyboard enthusiasts, so I was able to experiment a little to try and refine this design. The result: a very personalized switch layout that is custom-tailored to my typing style.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"builds/keyboards/personal/Hazards/#build-process","title":"Build Process","text":""},{"location":"builds/keyboards/personal/Hazards/#lubrication-and-preparation","title":"Lubrication and Preparation","text":"<p>The build process of this board was rather experimental in essence. I had some keyswitches in mind, but overall wasn't too picky about lesser-pressed keys. So I ended up ordering some Durock Linears for the alpha keys, Arctos 65g's for modifier keys, and decided that Halo Trues were a lot smoother of a tactile feel, so those should be in place for the mod keys that I'd be pressing more often with my weaker fingers. This being so, I decided I wanted a little more resistance over mod keys that I'd press less during gaming or press with my thumb, so <code>LWin</code>, <code>LAlt</code>, and <code>Space</code> were all Arctos. Because these were already slightly lubed from the factory, I found that it only needed a very light greasing to get the feeling just right while the springs needed a generous amount of lube to reduce on pinging sounds. However, due to the fact that I was building this board after having just finished working on two TKL builds and one numpad build, I allowed myself to be a little more lazy and decided the factory lube was enough for the most part, only touching up on spring ping and select switches that I found were the least consistently lubed.</p>"},{"location":"builds/keyboards/personal/Hazards/#evaluation","title":"Evaluation","text":"<p>After having lubed and put a good majority of switches through my quality control tests (comparing one switch to another by feel and sound), I separated the switches from most favourable to least and started placing the most favourable ones on the left end of the board (where most of the keys would be for gaming) and some on the right (around the arrow cluster area) while scattering the less favourable randomly so overall the good would be balanced with the bad and I won't notice any major inconsistency with quality. And for the most part, that worked just perfectly -- any of the Arctos switches that felt a little less lubed and more scratchy were ones I put closer to the <code>F9</code> to <code>F12</code> area as those keys are used significantly less than <code>F1</code> to <code>F6</code>.</p>"},{"location":"builds/keyboards/personal/Hazards/#soldering","title":"Soldering","text":"<p>The soldering process was rather trivial as at this point, I've had quite a lot of experience with soldering keyboards.

It was at this point that I noticed this particular set of keycaps didn't come with the \"homing bumps\" on the <code>F</code> and the <code>J</code> keys. While this is slightly unfortunate for someone like me who frequently types without looking at the keyboard, it didn't take too much time for me to just simply get used to placing my hands approximately where I needed them to be and start typing, adjusting my hand placement whenever needed. Additionally, this set didn't include the necessary keycaps for a split space-bar layout, so I decided to swap out the main space bar with two split bar pieces from the keycap set in my first build along with a slightly larger cap for the middle space key. This ended up working just perfectly for my needs.</p> <p>While this ended up being a board of mis-matched parts from other builds, overall it turned out to be one of my favourite builds to date, simply with the amount of thought put into the board in general as well as the customization done to the switches and the layout overall. I really enjoyed the process and it gave me a lot of confidence to build more layouts taht are bold, unique, and unmistakenly built for one individual only that one individual.

I had little to no experience in soldering, lubrication, or anything to do with keyboards other than typing. But I was determined to get into the hobby -- for the customizability, for the click-clacks, and for the community. So I ordered a kit with little knowledge of what I was getting myself into.</p> <p>This was my first ever custom keyboard, introducing me to the scene of DIY and custom mechanical builds. While I started off with an OEM gaming board, a majority of my life and interaction with computers was with membrane keyboards. So when it came time to build this board, it was a very exciting event for me. My main intention with this board was to immerse myself in the environment of building custom boards and learning as much as I can. To this point, it was designed to help me also learn my own preferences in a custom board and explore possible options for future builds. I ordered parts that would allow for the most repetition, which offered a lot of practice to refine my hands-on skills with custom electronics including keyswitch lubrication and soldering.</p>"},{"location":"builds/keyboards/personal/Honey-Smooth/#research","title":"Research","text":"<p>From my previous gaming board (using non-lubricated Cherry MX Red switches), I knew I wanted to use linear switches as I preferred a uniform action while typing and gaming. From absolutely everywhere I looked, I read that lubrication drastically improves switch sound and feel, so I found some tools to help with the lubrication process and learned where to apply the grease. While my primary aim was to learn from this build, I also wanted to make something that I would be happy using daily. So I went from a TKL gaming keyboard to a 65% to reduce on costs while still providing me with all the keys I'd need on a normal day (the arrow cluster is very regularly used on my boards). From here, I was sure I was ready to order everything. It took all of a few minutes to find the most budget-friendly parts and even look for further discounts from other websites.

I got to work, following the videos as a guide while experimenting using differing amounts of lube per each part. After about ten or so switches, I started to get the hang of the process. And so I started to lube the stabilizers before installing them. As with the guides, I tested the sound of the stabilizers with some modded switches and some keycaps from my older keyboard. It sounded alright enough to my untrained ear, so I turned on a nice D&amp;D podcast and proceeded to lube and film the rest of the 70 switches I've allocated to this build.</p>"},{"location":"builds/keyboards/personal/Honey-Smooth/#the-hot-stuff-soldering","title":"The Hot Stuff (Soldering)","text":"<p>The soldering process went rather smooth thanks to some of my previous experience with soldering through-hole and surface-mount electronics. However, I was only equipped with a beginner's soldering iron, some wick for mistakes, and a wet sponge to clean the tip. That all being said, beside having to remove one switch after it was already soldered (due to the switch not making proper contact and actuating when tested), I had no issues installing the switches to this board. In fact, it was quite a therapeutical activity for me to parttake in after a day of onboarding for my internship.</p>"},{"location":"builds/keyboards/personal/Honey-Smooth/#finishing-the-job","title":"Finishing the Job","text":"<p>After screwing in the plate to the case and installing keycaps, the board was finished (albeit with temporary caps as I had a new keycap set being shipped in the mail at the time).

And it feels really good when typing. In fact, I still use this keyboard for most of my typing, writing, productivity, and general computer usage when sat at my desk.</p> <p>However, it wasn't anything special for the fact of the stabilizers not being clipped (due to me not having flush cutters on hand at the time) or even having a band-aid mod installed (as I didn't know how that would benefit the sound signature). No, it was special because it was something I built. It helped me learn not only how a keyboard was built, but also how to tune specific configurations in the hardware, the firmware, and even change how the keyboard feels. It gave me ideas on how I'd want my next board to feel, gave me the ability to think outside of just uniform switch layouts and experiment with different concepts. It was something that I felt was my diving board into the world of not only mechanical keyboards, but DIY electronics as a whole.
